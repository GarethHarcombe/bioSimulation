				The red squares are organisms, going about their lives trying to survive. Simply existing requires energy - each second, every organism will lose energy, with larger and faster organisms using more energy. If they run out of energy, then they will die. Therefore, in order to survive, they must gain energy by eating food - the green squares - or if they are big enough, other organisms! If they gain enough energy to reproduce, they will do so, creating one offspring. However, this offspring has a chance for random mutations to occur, either increasing or decreasing its speed, size and ability to sense food. If this provides an adaptive advantage then the offspring will be more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, this results in the more favourable traits increasing in frequency.
